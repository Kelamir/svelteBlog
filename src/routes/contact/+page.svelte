<p>
    Oh how I wish I could reach out to you,
    But alas, I'm just a kitty cat, so what can I do?

    I'd love to talk and share with you,
    But I'm stuck inside my fur and I'm so out of view.

    You can't call me, you can't write me,
    I'm too small and too far away, you see?

    You can't email me, you can't text me,
    I'm simply a figment of your imagination, you see?

    If only cats could talk,
    Then I'd be able to have a conversation so we could walk.

    But for now, I'm stuck in my feline form,
    And I'm ever so sad, so please don't think I'm the norm.

    For now, it's impossible to make contact with me,
    But I hope one day, I can be set free.
